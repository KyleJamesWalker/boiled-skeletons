  <h1>About Skeletons</h1>
  <p class="lead">The skeleton (from Greek σκελετός, skeletos "dried body", "mummy"[1]) is the body part that forms the supporting structure of an organism. There are two different skeletal types: the exoskeleton, which is the stable outer shell of an organism, and the endoskeleton, which forms the support structure inside the body.</p>
